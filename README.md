# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Algorithm
This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python and C++. The Caesar Cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a fixed shift value to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Usage
### Python Version
To run the Python version of the Caesar Cipher algorithm, simply execute the Caesar_Cipher.py script using the command:
```python
python Caesar_Cipher.py
```
The script will present a menu that allows you to either encrypt or decrypt a message using a randomly generated key. When encrypting a message, the encrypted result will be saved to a file called encryption.txt. Similarly, when decrypting a message, the decrypted result will be saved to a file called decryption.txt.

### C++ Version
To run the C++ version of the Caesar Cipher algorithm, you need to compile the caesar-cipher.cpp source code using a C++ compiler, such as g++. You can use the following command to compile the code:
```C++
g++ -o Caesar_Cipher Caesar_Cipher.cpp
```

Once the code is compiled, you can run the resulting executable using the command:
```bash
./Caesar_Cipher
```
The program will present a menu that allows you to either encrypt or decrypt a message using a randomly generated key. When encrypting a message, the encrypted result will be saved to a file called encryption.txt. Similarly, when decrypting a message, the decrypted result will be saved to a file called decryption.txt.
